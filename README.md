# SDePER Analysis
This Github repository holds **data**, **Notebooks** and **results** of running SDePER on both Simulated and Real datasets, and **Notebooks** for figure panels in manuscript, as well as the **codes** for running other cell type deconvolution methods.

For **source code**, please refer Github repository [SDePER](https://github.com/az7jh2/SDePER).

**Homepage**: https://az7jh2.github.io/SDePER/.

**Full Documentation** for SDePER is available on [Read the Docs](https://sdeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
