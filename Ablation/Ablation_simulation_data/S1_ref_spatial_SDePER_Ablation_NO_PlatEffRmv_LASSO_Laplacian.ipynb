    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we run ablation test on SDePER on simulated data. For generating simulated data via coarse-graining procedure please refer [generate_simulated_spatial_data.nb.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/az7jh2/SDePER_Analysis/c60dcb036816bd61b5a8b3752d473a5b591b52b6/Simulation/Generate_simulation_data/generate_simulated_spatial_data.nb.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1** means the reference data for deconvolution includes all single cells with the **matched 12 cell types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial data as reference** means the reference data is actually the STARmap spatial transcriptomic data which is used to generate the simulated data, therefore it's **free of platform effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NO platform effect removal** means we conduct cell type deconvolution **disregarding platform effect**, meaning that neither CVAE nor an additive gene-wise platform effect term is utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WITHOUT sparsity penalty** means we fit the graph Laplacian regularized model without the sparsity penalty, specifically omitting Adaptive LASSO regularization (by setting the command option `--lambda_r` to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**WITHOUT spatial correlation constraint** means we fit the graph Laplacian regularized model the spatial correlation constraint, essentially removing Laplacian regularization (by setting the command option `--lambda_g` to 0)\n",
